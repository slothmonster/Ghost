Foundation is made by ZURB, a product design company in Campbell, California. We've put more than 15 years of experience building web products, services and websites into this framework.

Users will feel the speed. Interchange now enables HTML partials for device specific content. Smoother animations and transitions happen with hardware acceleration. The default styles are all updated.

Everything is semantic. You can have the cleanest markup without sacrificing the utility and speed of Foundation. You can build for small devices first. Then, as devices get larger and larger, layer in more complexity for a complete responsive design.

You can customize your build to include or remove certain elements, as well as define the size of columns, colors, font size and more. Millions of designers and developers depend on Foundation. Now we have business support, training and consulting to help grow your product or service.
