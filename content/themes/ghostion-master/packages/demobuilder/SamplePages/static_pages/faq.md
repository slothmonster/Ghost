## Ghostion Theme FAQ

Got a question? Check out the following FAQs.

#### 1. Why is Ghostion theme free?
Ghost is free. Foundation 5, Bourbon, and all resources we use for Ghostion are free as well. We love them all and we love you too, so we make Ghostion **free** for you.

#### 2. Can I customize Ghostion theme?
Absolutely, yes! We provide full source of Ghostion theme including the editable logo source, the SCSS and JavaScript files. We even provide you our custom command line tool to speed up your customization.

Customize your SCSS, JavaScript files, all your change will be automatically compiled. Type the release command line, and you are done!

For more information about using our custom command line tool, please check our [Documentation](/documentation) page.

#### 3. Can I use Ghostion as the based theme for my commercial theme? Any copyright restriction?
Feel free to copy, modify, customize, distribut or anything you want with Ghostion as long as you don't sell Ghostion theme itself directly "as is" :)

#### 4. Wow! Are you serious? Why do you give all your hardwork free?
Yes, we are serious. Please read FAQ No. 1 :)

#### 5. Okay. I don't want to customize Ghostion, I like how it looks right now. What should I do?
You will need to change the logo with yours and we provide the editable Logo source that you can edit with Adobe Fireworks / Photoshop. You can also use your own logo and upload the new logo via Ghost administration.

After that, you need to check and edit the Ghostion configuration file located at ``/ghostion/default.hbs``

```
/*** CONFIGURATION VARIABLES: EDIT THE VALUES BELOW FOR THEME CONFIGURATION ***/
var ghostionConfig = {
	site_url: 						"ghostion.ghostdemo.axiantheme.com",
	google_fonts_family: 			"Open+Sans:400,400italic,700,700italic",
	google_analytics_tracking_id: 	"UA-45630355-2",
	disqus_shortname: 				"ghostion"
};
```

You are done :) You got the exact configuration we use on Ghostion demo site.

#### 6. Hmm, I have changed the configuration file, but my blog is still not same like the demo. Why?
If you installed a new fresh Ghost, then your blog only contains one post. We also provide the **post source** we use for the demo. Just copy and paste it to your blog to replicate the demo. Alternatively, please use our DemoBuilder JSON data.

For more information about Ghostion DemoBuilder, please check our [Documentation](/documentation) page.

#### 7. I found a bug, how can I contact you?
If you found a bug or have any questions not answered here, please send us an email at <support@axiantheme.com> or tweet us [@axiantheme](https://twitter.com/axiantheme). We will do our best to help you.

#### 8. Seriously, how can I thank you?
Simple :) Download and use Ghostion theme, then share the awesomeness to your friends on Twitter, Facebook, email, etc.
